Hi 
@Isabel Zilh√£o
 :slightly_smiling_face: Yes you should follow the instructions :slightly_smiling_face:
The easiest way to use your custom icons is to have your own icons renamed to match the names that come from the API and then instead of using the API full URL as the src of the <img> element, you just need to replace it the local path to your own images.
You can find all Weather Condition filenames here: https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
Then instead of having
  icon.setAttribute(
    "src",
   `http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${response.data.weather[0].icon}@2x.png`
  );
You just need to have
  icon.setAttribute(
    "src",
   `images/${response.data.weather[0].icon}.png`
  );
PS: for this to work you should have all images with the same file format. You have some JPG and some PNG, you should choose one format and have all matching that one (I suggest you keep PNG)
